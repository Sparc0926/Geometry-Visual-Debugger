About Geometry Figure Instances:
	1. Every instance should be created INBETWEEN Canvas::Figure2::Begin() and Canvas::Figure2::End() instructions;
	2. Every instance should be created on the HEAP and will be deleted automatically after the main window is terminated;
	3. Addresses of all points will be stored inside Canvas::Figure2::Points[512] but NOT guaranteed to be in creation order. (Same for other instances)
